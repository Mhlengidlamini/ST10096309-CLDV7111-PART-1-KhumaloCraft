    Our Vision
</h1>
<p>
    James Khumalo, our founder, grew up immersed in the rich tapestry of cultural heritage and artisanal craftsmanship of his hometown. 
    Fascinated by the stories each handmade item told, James envisioned a space where these stories could be shared and celebrated on a global scale. 
    With a background in technology and a heart deeply rooted in community and culture, James has steered KhumaloCraft to become a platform that showcases handcrafted goods and fosters direct connections between artisans and the global community.
